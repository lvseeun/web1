  <h1>Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald</h1>
  <h2>(September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940)</h2>
    <p><strong>Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald</strong> (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and short-story writer. He was best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age—a term which he popularized. During his lifetime, he published four novels, four collections of short stories, and 164 short stories. Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald only received wide critical and popular acclaim after his death. <u>He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.</u></p>

  <h3>[Early Life]</h3>
    <p>Born on September 24, 1896, in Saint Paul, Minnesota,[1] to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his second cousin thrice removed, Francis Scott Key,[2][note 1] but was always known as Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was also named after his deceased sister, Louise Scott Fitzgerald,[4] one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. "Well, three months before I was born," he wrote as an adult, "my mother lost her other two children ... I think I started then to be a writer."[5] His father, Edward Fitzgerald, was of Irish and English ancestry, and had moved to St. Paul from Maryland after the American Civil War.[6][7][8] His mother was Mary "Molly" McQuillan Fitzgerald, the daughter of an Irish immigrant who had made his fortune in the wholesale grocery business.[6] Edward's first cousin once removed, Mary Surratt, was hanged in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.</p>
  <h3>[Zelda Fitzgerald]</h3>

    <p>In 1918, Fitzgerald was commissioned a second lieutenant and dispatched to Camp Sheridan near Montgomery, Alabama, serving with the 45th and 67th Infantry Regiments.[34] While at a local country club, Fitzgerald met and fell in love with Zelda Sayre, the youngest daughter of Alabama Supreme Court Justice Anthony D. Sayre and the "golden girl", in Fitzgerald's terms, of Montgomery society.[35] They began a courtship, but were briefly interrupted in October when he was summoned north. He expected to be sent to France, but was instead assigned to Camp Mills, Long Island. While stationed there, the Armistice with Germany was signed. He then returned to the base near Montgomery and began meeting Zelda again.[36][37] Together again, they embarked on what he would later call "sexual recklessness," and by December, they were inseparable.[36][37] In what became a lifetime practice, Fitzgerald relied on Zelda for literary inspiration, going so far as to plagiarize her diary while revising his first novel.</p>
 <h3>[New York and the Jazz Age]</h3>
    <p>After the birth of Scottie, Fitzgerald returned to writing The Beautiful and Damned,[51] but in early 1922, Zelda became pregnant for a second time. Although some writers have claimed that his diaries include an entry referring to "Zelda and her abortionist", there is, in fact, no such entry. Zelda's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown, but in the first draft of The Beautiful and Damned, he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she "talk to some woman and find out what's best to be done. Most of them fix it some way." Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a baby would ruin her figure.[52][53] Chapters of the book were serialized in Metropolitan Magazine in late 1921, and in March 1922, the book was published. Scribner's prepared an initial print run of 20,000 copies, and mounted an advertising campaign. It sold well enough to warrant additional print runs reaching 50,000 copies.[54] That year, Fitzgerald also released Tales of the Jazz Age, which was composed of 11 short stories, all but two written before 1920.[55] This collection's title would lend itself to the eponymous time period.</p>
